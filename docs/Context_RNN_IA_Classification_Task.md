# 📊 Time Series Classification with Recurrent Neural Networks

## 🎯 Objective
Replicate the in-class exercise using data collected from a mobile device to train and compare different recurrent neural network models.

---

## 📝 Instructions

1. **Data Collection**
   - Use the accelerometer from your mobile device.
   - Collect data using the **Edge Impulse** platform for **at least four movement classes**.
   - Export the captured data to use it in a Python script.

2. **Model Training**
   - Train a model based on a **simple recurrent neural network (RNN)** to classify the collected data.
   - Train a model using **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)** networks to classify the same data.

3. **Model Evaluation & Comparison**
   - Evaluate the performance of both models using **appropriate metrics** (e.g., accuracy, recall, F1-score).
   - Compare the results of the two models.

4. **Model Architecture Analysis**
   - Provide **diagrams of the model architectures**.
   - Include the **parameter count** for each layer in the models.

## 📦 Deliverables

- 🧠 **Google Colab** notebooks containing the implemented and well-commented code.
- 📁 The **dataset** used during the activity.
- 🎬 A **video explanation** (maximum **15 minutes**) describing the process and results.
